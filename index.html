                <div class="box box1">
                    <h2>Your and You're</h2>
                    <p>Irony is when someone writes "Your an idiot".
                    </p>
                    <p>It's very hard to take someone seriously when they try to insult you using incorrect grammar; when they leave you a comment on the internet saying, "Your stupid." My stupid what? Did something happen before you had the chance to finish your sentnece? Is this a cry for help? SHOULD I SEND HELP?!? This was my knee jerk reaction the first time this happened. I quickly learned that there was nothing wrong with the commenter other than their poor command of hte English language (which, if I'm honest, is far more appalling).</p>
                    <p>It should be a requirement for people to know the difference between the two words before being able to comment and write posts online. How can I take this seriously enough to be offended by it? It is way more offensive to be confronted with the reality that many, many speakers of the English language do not know the difference between "your" and "you're" when it's so very simple. "You're" means "you are" and "your" shows ownership. All you have to do is ask youself, would this sentence still make sense if I said "you are" instead? If it does, it's "you're". If it doesn't, it's "your". Simple enough.

                <div class="box box2">
                    <h2>Their, They're and There</h2>
                    <p>THEY are going to THEIR house becuase you're not THERE. It's not rocket science. Seriously. "Their" - just like "my", "our", "YOUR" - shows possession. They're is a contraction, it is short for "They are" or "They were". And "There" is a place. It is the opposite of "here".
                    </p>
                    <p>On a serious note, this is a problem for learners and a lot of English native speakers because these words are homophones: they have the same pronounciation but different spellings. Good news is: with practice, you can easily get a hang of them, you simply have to ask yourself what it is you're trying to say.
