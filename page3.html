                    <h2>Punctuation...</h2>
                    <p>THe absence of punctuation such as commas can change the entire meaning of sentences. For example, there's a cannibalistic difference between "I like cooking my family and pets" and "I like cooking, my family, and pets".
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are some more examples where the addtion of commas change a lot: "Let's eat, grandma!" and "Let's eat grandma!". In the first scenario, you are asking your dearest grandma to join you for a lunch. In the second, your grandma IS the lunch.
                    </p>
                    <p>As you've seen commas are essential for separating things. They come in handy when writing lists; there, they are used to separate, bracket and group things. For exmaple, "I collect silver, paper, hats and chairs", "I collect silver paper, hats and chairs", and "I collect silver, paper hats and chairs" all have different meanings. I'll leave that for you to figure out.
                    </p>

                <div class="box box2">
                    <h2>...continued</h2>
                    <p>The use of hyphens, apostrophes, colons, and the lot makes a difference, too! If someone told you you'd won twenty-five dollar bills ($25) you'd be less impressed than if you'd won twenty five-dollar bills ($100), right? A man eating chicken would make you think of what's for dinner (hopefully not your grandma), while a man-eating chicken would have you running for the hills! I could go on!
                    </p> 
                    <p>In short, use punctiation to covey the intended information, but be wary of using them incorrecty. You've seen how easy it is now to say the wrong thing. Here's another emabbrassing mistake: "A woman, without her man, is nothing.". The correct thing would have been: "A woman: without her, man is nothing.".
                    </p>
                    <p>You've one final lesson left now...
