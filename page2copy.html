                    <h2>Two, To and Too</h2>
                    <p>Aha! Another wretched case of homophones!
                    </p>
                    <p>Firstly, two is a number, as in 1, 2, 3. There, easy enough, right? Don't forget. Now, what's the difference between "to" and "too"? Well, "to" shows direction and can be used in the place of the word "towards". It is a proposition. The other, "too", is an adverb. It has the same meaning as "also", "as well" and "additionally". You'd do well TO remember the difference before it's TOO late.

                    <h2>Who and Whom</h2>
                    <p>This one I can almost forgive... but you know what they say: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKVsRBjMWuk&ab_channel=ArianaGrande-Topic" target="_blank">almost is never enough.</a></p>
                    <p>I can almost forgive mixing them up because "who" and "whom" are both ponouns. The difference is that "who" refers to the subect in the sentence while "whom" refers to the object - much like "I" and "me". Put simply, "who" is the person doing the action, hence it tends to come before the verb. "Whom", on the other hand, is receiving the action. It tends to come after the words "from" and "to". Not too straightforward, put not too difficult either. Go ahead and learn the difference. I believe in you.
